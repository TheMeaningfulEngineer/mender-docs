!!! If you are interested in evaluating Mender features as an end to end solution, please visit
!!! [Get Started](../../01.Get-started/chapter.md)


This section covers two ways to set up an evaluation instance of Mender:
* [docker-compose based](./01.Docker-compose/docs.md)
* [Kubernetes based](./02.Kubernetes/docs.md)


Please note that neither of the setups is intended for production.
For production installation please check [production installation with Kubernetes](../04.Production-installation-with-kubernetes/docs.md).
